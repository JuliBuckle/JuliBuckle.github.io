        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Brazilian, and I have been studying Software Engineering at ASU online. I currently work as an Application Engineer / Software Developer at a company in Carpinteria, CA and I also have a second job as a Fitness Coach. I am trying to get better at my skills so I can find a job I enjoy more doing and which will pay me better than where I work, as they use a lot of legacy coding which is harder to work with and less valuable in today’s world! But isn’t it what we all want? </p>

        <h2>My Goals</h2>
        <p>My goals are to improve and get my skills in front-end developing up to date by considerably increasing my knowledge in JavaScript, being part of projects that will be openly displayed in my portfolio, and by building web applications with great functionality and purpose. </p>
